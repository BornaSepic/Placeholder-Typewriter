## Why *Another* Date Management tool?
Several npms utilize multiple dependencies, and lead to code bloat.  There are also several modules on the market that are very opinionated (e.g. force you to do certain things) or are focused on a single form of date management.  This tool aims to be a lightweight, flexible solution that allows for infinitely customizable options to suit user needs.

## Getting Started
- Install [the npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-utilz) in your project: `npm install --save date-utilz`
- Require the library where needed: `const O = require('date-utilz');`
- Manage dates in a more seamless way.
